# CheatBreaker Removal Tool
A simple way of completely nuking CheatBreaker in one fell swoop. It deletes the files for the program, any data left behind by it in AppData and removes shortcuts. This tool, however, doesn't remove the Prefetch files for CheatBreaker, but that shouldn't make a difference.

# Usage
Just run `cbrt.exe`.

# Download
https://github.com/LewisTehMinerz/CBRT/releases

# Compiling
Install [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download) and open MakeNSISW. Drag `cbrt.nsi` into the window and it will produce a file called `cbrt.exe`.
